You will also see any lint errors in the console.

To run the **backend**, download this project [https://github.com/brianndungunjenga/passportIdmrzBackend], copy/move it to the same directory as **passportReaderFrontEnd**.

For example:
**- passportReaderFrontEnd**
**- passportIdmrzBackend**

Then **cd passportIdmrzBackend** and **mkdir uploads**

The uploads directory is where the images will be saved.


Then run from passportReaderFrontEnd:

### `yarn backend-api` to run the api<br/>
